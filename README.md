# Movie_review_app
This is a full stack project. 
For backend I used Java Spring Boot framework;
For database I used mongoDB (2 collections: 1) Movies; 2) Reviews);
For frontend I used React JS. 
In movie review app you can view trailer of a movie and leave a comment that is going to be seen by everyone.
